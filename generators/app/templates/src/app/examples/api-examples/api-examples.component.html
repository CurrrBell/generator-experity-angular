    </header>
    <p>
      Angular makes API calls pretty straightforward with the HttpClient. Below is a simple call to the version info
      endpoint of the MessagingApi:
    </p>
    <div id="api-example">
      <h4>Base Version: <span *ngIf=versionInfo>{{versionInfo.versionBase}}</span>
      </h4>
      <h4>Version: <span *ngIf=versionInfo>{{versionInfo.version}}</span>
      </h4>
      <button mat-raised-button (click)="onClick()">Get API Version Info</button>
    </div>
    <p>
      To set up an API call, start by generating a data access service for HTTP requests. The ExampleDataService
      in this app uses Angular's HttpClient to make a call to the <code>GetVersionInfo</code> endpoint:
    </p>

    </figure>
    <p>
      Next, create a data model (e.g. VersionInfoModel) with properties matching the JSON that will be
      returned in the HTTP response. The data service can now be called directly from the component and handle the
      Promise returned by <code>getApiVersion()</code>. This is done in the <code>onClick()</code> event handler which
      will call the data service and put the results directly into the model.

      <h3>Handling Errors</h3>
    </header>
    <p>
      What happens if something goes wrong during the API call? Hit F12 to open DevTools, click on the "Console"
      tab, and try throwing an error:
    </p>
    <button class="bad-api-call" mat-raised-button (click)="badApiCall()">Bad API Call</button>
    <p>
      You should see a 404 (Not Found) error logged to the console along with the exception data. While this is helpful
      enough for a development scenario, silently logging the exception is a rather poor user experience. That
      experience can be improved by using the <code>ErrorService</code> included in this template:
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="../../../assets/images/api-examples/error-handling.png">
    </figure>
    <p>
      This way, if an error is thrown, the <code>err</code> block will execute and call
      <code>ErrorService.showError()</code>. Let's see how the error behaves now:
    </p>
    <button class="bad-api-call" mat-raised-button (click)="handledBadApiCall()">Bad API Call</button>
    <p>
      The browser still logs a 404 to the console, but the ugly error JSON is no longer output. More importantly, we
      notify the user that something has gone wrong and lay out some options for reacting to that error.
